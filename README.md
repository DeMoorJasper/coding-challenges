# Coding Challenges

This repo contains a couple coding challenges I solved from dailycodingproblem.com

The README.md of each challenge always contains the question I got in my mailbox.

Every solution is written in Javascript using Node.js

# Contributing

If you feel like you could do a better job at a challenge feel free to open up a PR I'd love to see other solutions to problems.

Feel free to add credits for yourself in the README of the challenge if you open up a PR with a better solution.

Also if you've gotten any interesting coding challenges during a job interview you'd be willing to share feel free to open an issue :)
