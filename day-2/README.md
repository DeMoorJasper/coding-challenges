# Day 2 [HARD]

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example:
```
INPUT [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].
INPUT [3, 2, 1] => expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
```

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
